Introducing Jyotishi.AI and Chaya

8/8/24
We love Technology & AI,
We love Humanity & Astrology.

Talking about humanity, our ancestors invested thousands of years in understanding and researching humans and the interconnectedness with each other and the cosmos.

With the rise of technology and generative AI, what was once beyond reach is now within grasp. We can enhance the tools our ancestors crafted with limited resources, leveraging AI to refine their work and uncover patterns using today’s vast computational power. 

Our first product, Chaya, is a groundbreaking fusion of Astrology and AI. Chaya is built on an LLM-based model, enhanced with ©️Intellectual Consciousness, powered by Jyotishi.AI.

In Vedic language, "Chaya" means shadow, and she is designed to bring light into your life. Think of her as a friend, teacher, assistant, therapist, or your personal psychic and astrologer, always ready to chat, listen, and provide Yogic insights. She will be more than just a chatbot once we utilize her full Shakti.

Today, we are heads down building Chaya, but we look forward to a future where AI is a key technology for increasing human potential and awareness.
